    <h1>Energy Open Piazza</h1>
    <h2>Curated Resources List</h2>
    <p>Some notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The list started for research while applying for grant in the UK so most resources make sense for this market.</li>
      <li>We are focusing on electricity data exchange, so most of the resources see the problem from this point of view.</li>
      <li>Categories have grown organically with content, they don't follow a specific taxonomy and are subject to change.</li>
    </ul>
